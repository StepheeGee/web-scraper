### What is a web scraper?

A web scraper is a program that automates the process of extracting data from websites. It works by using the [BeautifulSoup library](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape the data from the website. 

Playwright is a headless browser library that makes it easy to automate web scraping.
